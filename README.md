Spring Core project. I'v used Spring library for dependency injection and managing of application objects.
Covers the Core module of Spring Framework, different approaches to bean wiring, 
XML and annotation configuration, autowiring, AOP and JDBC.
             
I'v created:
1. Spring configuration for project;
2. Beans, constructor arguments and bean properties;
3. Wire with XML and annotations (using Autowiring);
4. Aspects
5. Connection to database and execute queries with JDBCTemplate;

In this project I'v performed overview the next main principles:
- Spring architecture;
- Dependency injection;
- Bean naming and Context creating;
- Scopes and inner Beans;
- Initialize and Destroy
- Context features;
- Property injections;
- Annotation wiring;
- AOP;
- JDBCTemplate;
